# Purpose
A program designed to help posting using the HUGO system.

A while ago I changed from a Wordpress blog to a statically generated one. I picked Hugo to help with this as I just liked the way it worked. 
After a little bit of effort I got my new website up and working and I am really pleased with the way it looks. One thing that I miss is the ability to write a post either online or via a program that linked into the Wordpress infrastructure. So after not posting for a while on my blog I realised that the need to write the .md file with TOML headers was slowing me down.

So, what should I do. Well the decision was to learn Go Language and write a program to help me to post more.

It would be great to just plug in to the Matrix and know Go Language but life is not like that. I am learning Go and finding out ways of doing things and adding features as I go along.

If I am missing something please raise an issue. Please though bear in mind I am learning to use

- Go Language
- Git
- HTML
- CSS
- Visual Studio Editor

all at the same time.

Any advice will be gratefully accepted (but cannot be paid for), any issues will be looked at and will eventually be fixed, feature requests will be added to the end of the list. Please be gentle if you are pointing out any stupidity on my side.
